Car Parking System simulator
## A Raspberry Pi project 


This is a simulation of a car parking payment system that requires the crypto currency 
e.g. Bitcoin, as payment method. 
The system will detect that the vehicle is close to the payment device using a Sensor component, and then it presents a QR code image referred to a Bitcoin public address and total due, using a LCD component, so that the user can read the total due and scan the code to conveniently pay with a Smartphone. The system will then check whether the payment itâ€™s confirmed, and if yes, rotate a servo to simulate opening of a parking gate. However due to some unpredictable issues, some adaptations to the initial solution have been made.
